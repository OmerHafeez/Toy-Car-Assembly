You were orphaned at an early age. To make ends meet, you sought work in a local
toy car workshop in your city, and your job is to build toy cars from a collection of parts. Each toy
car needs 4 wheels, 1 car body, and 2 figures of people to be placed inside. You notice that
sometimes, you’ll get orders of the number of cars to make, but you won’t have the total required
parts available. To prevent this, you want to find out how many complete toy cars can you make,
given the total number of wheels, car bodies and figures available at hand currently.
